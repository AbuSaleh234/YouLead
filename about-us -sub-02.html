				<h2>Youth in Politics</h2>
				<img src="images/Rectangle 101(3).png" alt="..." class="w-100">
				<h3>Youth Inclusion & Participation in Political Governance</h3>
				<p>On one hand, it is evident that youth political representation in most countries of the region has gradually increased; either through affirmative action or deliberate initiatives by the youth who compete for and take up political positions. This, however, according to the youth themselves, has not translated into the desired impact for the broader youth constituency; both at national and regional levels. Observers and commentators argue that the political inclinations, policy choices, and behaviors of those in political leadership do not often march the desires, aspirations, and hopes of young people in this region.</p>
				<p>YouLead seeks to build key programs at the national level, feed into the regional and continental levels with the aim of effectively disrupting the national and regional trends in political leadership to create an intentional focus on youth needs, aspirations, and hopes for sustainable good governance. Current political trends suggest a discrepancy between youth needs and political and policy priorities.</p>
				<h3>Global trends in Youth participation</h3>
				<p>On the other hand, despite the progress made, given their high proportion of the world population, youth are vastly underrepresented in political institutions. For example, “2.2 percent of the world’s MPs are aged under 30 – up from 1.9 percent in 2016; 15.5 percent of the world’s MPs are aged under 40 – up from 14.2 per cent in 2016; 28.1 percent of the world’s MPs are aged under 45 – up from 26 per cent in 2016 and male MPs outnumber their female counterparts in every age group”. Though, young people under 30 make up just [slightly] over 2 percent of the world’s MPs; just over 30 per cent of the world’s single and lower houses of parliament have no MPs aged under 30; seventy-six per cent of the world’s upper houses of parliament have no MPs aged under 30. This reality is reflected in Africa’s political institutions and processes. Available data shows not only limited gender inclusive youth participation in governance but also limited youth participation in general.</p>
				<h3>What’s holding the Youth back from becoming?</h3>
				<p>Evidence shows that 63% of youth believe they are not receiving the proper training for them to be effective leaders. Some of the challenges they experience include lack of an intentional framework for existing leaders to nurture and mentor young people into leadership. </p>
				<p>Youth believe current leaders are not doing enough to bridge the generation and leadership capability gap in order to ensure a new generation of leaders is created. Hence, there is limited deliberate mentorship and coaching for young and upcoming leaders. This has been expressed by young people as a lack of understanding that youth can be effective and bring about positive change when put in leadership</p>
				<h3>The Demand</h3>
				<p>World over and in Africa, the top concern among Millennials is that of becoming a leader. Their demand is simple: it is time-out for exclusive leadership and time-in for inclusive leadership!<br>Recent research shows that 91% of youth aspire to be a leader. Given their distinctive needs and aspirations, youth in general and with more reference to Millennials, are changing the way the world views leadership. Youth can lead and are already offering themselves for leadership at various levels of society.</p>

				<h2>Youth in Business, Trade & Enterprise</h2>
				<p>Youth Inclusion & Participation in Economic Governance<br>The African Union, Regional Economic Commissions, with support from development partners have put in place policies, institutional frameworks and infrastructure to create an enabling environment for business in Africa – the latest of these being the mighty AfCFTA. These are aimed at accelerating African regional integration through the creation of a continental village. However, even with the existence of such frameworks, most African youth in business have reported less or no direct (positive) impact on their business operations; doubting the effectiveness and applicability of the policy frameworks to youth led businesses.</p>
			</div>
			<img src="images/Rectangle 103.png" alt="..." class="w-100">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Our Interventions</h2>
				<p>Leveraging on existing frameworks, with key stakeholders at national, regional and continental levels, YouLead seeks to create platforms aimed at exploring the extent to which young people are aware of existing policy frameworks. We create platforms and facilitate constructive social dialogue between African youth and policy makers at all levels and to have youth voices heard and ensure policy makers respond to calls from youth.</p>
				<p>Through our Youth Governance Architecture Studies, we conduct participatory assessments to carefully examine the extent to which these policies create an enabling environment for youth-led businesses and work with and advise policy makers, development partners, private sector and other actors on best ways to investing in youth entrepreneurship, innovation capital, and challenge them to take proactive measures to include young business leaders in economic policy decision-making processes for a youth friendly business policy environment.</p>
				<p>We conduct business skills trainings and boot camps to empower youth to ensure they have the prerequisite knowledge and skills to develop their ideas into enterprises and manage them into successful businesses as well as position themselves for maximum benefit from existing policy environments, emerging technology, and physical infrastructure both at national and regional levels.</p>
