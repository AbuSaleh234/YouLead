							<p>Current Initiatives
								YouLead Summit (Link to www.youleadsummit.org) 
								We convene the annual YouLead Summit co-hosted with the East African Community and other partners. YouLead Summit is YouLead’s annual climax event since 2017 and is now East Africa’s largest forum of young leaders, mentors, government officials and youth organizations representatives from all the 6 EAC Partner States (Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan) to focus on crafting responses to the region’s rapidly growing youth population, their challenges and opportunities. It now YouLead Summit Africa, with regional YouLead Summit to be organised prior to the continental YouLead Summiteach.</p>

							<h2>Two focus areas define conversations at YouLead Summit:</h2>
							<p>a) Youth in Politics - how youth leadership can be reinvented and entrenched)
							b) Youth in Business and Enterprise - how youth might meaningfully engage in national and cross border entrepreneurship/business in East Africa taking advantage of an already existing enabling regional policy and institutional environment).</p> 
							 
							<p>Over 10000 youth leaders, mentors, government officials, youth issues experts participate in each YouLead Summit edition in Arusha Tanzania and via internet mediated online platforms, and many more others participate at country level through pre-summit events.</p>
							<p>AfCFTA Youth Inclusion Accelerator Project (AfCFTA-YIAP).<br> 
							MSTCDC/YouLead Secretariat in collaboration with GIZ AU and Strategic Partners (Youth-led and Youth-serving Organisations) across Africa are implementing the AfCFTA Youth Inclusion Accelerator Project (AfCFTA-YIAP). 
							Recognising the role African RECs will play in the coordination and implementation of the AfCFTA, and to ensure sustainable youth engagement while also ensuring governmental ownership for the project and its processes and outputs, YouLead Secretariat is collaborating with its key REC partner the East African Community (EAC) through its youth engagement structure - the East African Community Youth Ambassadors Platform (EACYAP).</p>
							<p>To cover the entire continent, YouLead has incorporated a continental youth community of interest around the AfCFTA through a Continental ad hoc Youth Working Group and co-opted Collaborating Entities as support and mobilization structures. These elements and steps are directed toward increased continental ownership of AfCFTA among the leading community of youth-led initiatives especially those with a progressive voice on or interest in the AfCFTA already across the continent - the continental youth collective will serve as a mass voice of African youth on matters of AfCFTA.</p>

							<p>As part of the AfCFTA-YIAP implementation, YouLead is carrying out a series of Regional Consultations with youth leaders and policy makers to inform a Continental Scoping Study on African Young Peoples’ Awareness of the AfCFTA and their perceived role as stakeholders in its implementation. The All-Africa High-Level Virtual Roundtable on AfCFTA Youth Inclusion is the Climax Event to the ongoing regional roundtables, and will facilitate a conversation between African young leaders, continental policy makers, development partners, eminent business leaders and other key actors on the future of Africa under AfCFTA - with youth at the centre.</p>

							<h4>The AfCFTA-YIAP: African Young Peoples’ Awareness of the AfCFTA, their role as stakeholders in its implementation and why it matters</h4>
							<p>First, with 65% of Africa's population being below the age of 35 years, Africa is the world’s youngest continent. This trajectory presents both opportunities and challenges for the continent’s peace and development agenda - estimates indicate that half of Africa’s young people are at the risk of not securing decent employment or access to means of production and economic opportunities. Key question 1: To what extent will the AfCFTA contribute toward creating an enabling environment for youth-led cross-border entrepreneurship innovation to flourish? Secondly, Africa’s youth demographic dividend offers a human resource potential for a fastened implementation of the AfCFTA in favour of Africa’s transformation agenda.  Key question 2:  Are African youth adequately aware, skilled, mobilised and capacitated to play a role in the implementation of AfCFTA? Finally, for African governments, development partners, private sector and other key actors, investing in youth entrepreneurship innovation capital and taking proactive measures to include young business and political leaders in decision-making associated with the AfCFTA processes should be observed as an indicator of success on the AfCFTA implementation Progress Index (should there be one day). Key question3: What role can African youth play in the implementation of the AfCFTA and what can/should African Governments, Development Partners, Private Sector, Academia, Civil Society and other key actors do to enable meaningful participation and maximum benefits of AfCFTA to African youth?
