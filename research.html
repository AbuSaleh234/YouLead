									<h4>Inaugural Research Initiatives 2020</h4>
									<p>1. Youth Governance Architecture in the East African Community<br>Examining the Enabling Environment for Youth Participation and exploring opportunities for re-inventing and entrenching Youth Leadership</p>
									<p>In 2020, MSTCDC/YouLead Secretariat and the African Legal Think Tank on Women’s Rights, under the MS TCDC Leadership Governance Academy (LGA), joined forces to deliver the research project “The Youth Governance Architecture in East African Community: Examining the Enabling Environment for Youth Participation in Governance and exploring opportunities for re-inventing and entrenching youth leadership”, as part of the broader theme “Democracy Monitoring Studies”.</p>
									<h4>2. Youth Governance Architecture in the East African Community</h4>
									<p>Youth inclusion and participation in Governance – why it matters</p>
									<p>There are more young people today than ever before. More than half of the world population is under 30 years of age, and one-fifth of it is made up of youth aged 15-25. Despite this high proportion of the world population, youth are vastly underrepresented in political institutions. For example, “2.2 percent of the world’s MPs are aged under 30 – up from 1.9 percent in 2016; 15.5 percent of the world’s MPs are aged under 40 – up from 14.2 per cent in 2016;  28.1 percent of the world’s MPs are aged under 45 – up from 26 per cent in 2016 and male MPs outnumber their female counterparts in every age group”. This data shows not only limited gender inclusive youth participation in governance but also limited youth participation in general.<br>Yet, world over, given their distinctive needs and aspirations, youth in general and with more reference to Millennials, are changing the way we view leadership. Their demand is simple: it is time-out for exclusive leadership and time-in for inclusive leadership.<br>More on the study  and its findings here…</p>
									<h4>3. Youth Can Kick COVID-19 out of East Africa</h4>
									<p>Africa Study on Covid-19 Disruptions to Youth life May, 2020 | The YouLead Consortium</p>
									<p>This report represents voices and experiences of East African youth, the disruptions by the Covid-19 pandemic to their life so far, their thoughts on how they could make a contribution toward preparedness and response to Covid-19, and their wish list for support now and after the pandemic. More on the study  and its findings here…</p>
									<h4>4. Continental Scoping Study on the Enabling Environment for Youth Participation in Political Governance and Mapping of Existing Youth Leadership Development Initiatives in Africa</h4>
									<p>Part of the African Union Emerging Leaders Program: Reinventing Leadership for African Youth in Democratic Governance</p>
									<p>A continental project with funding from African Union (AGA Secretariat) and COMESA Secretariat through a Technical Service Agreement</p>
									<p>Summary<br>Through its youth engagement initiative, YouLead, the Training Centre for Development Cooperation (MS-TCDC) has received a service agreement from the African Union African Governance Architecture Secretariat and COMESA Secretariat to develop a training manual for an “Emerging Leaders Program: Reinventing Leadership for African Youth in Democratic Governance''. In delivering the assignment, YouLead is closely cooperating with the East African Community (EAC) Youth Ambassadors Platform and has mobilized a Continental Youth Reference Group to support the process.<br>More on the study  and its findings here…</p>
									<h4>5. East Africa Study on the enabling Environment for Youth inclusion in Economic Governance</h4>
									<p>Revitalising Multistakeholder Partnerships for Accelerating Economic Opportunities and Decent Work for Youth in the East African Community</p>
									<p>Summary<br>Africa is the world’s youngest continent, with 65% of the total population estimated to be below the age of 35 years and over 35% being between the ages of 18 and 35 years. According to the AU Youth Division, Africa is home to the world’s majority young people. This trajectory presents both opportunities and challenges as far as the peace and development agenda are concerned. For example, current estimates indicate that half of Africa’s young people are at the risk of not securing decent gainful employment or having access to means of production and associated economic opportunities. Central to this study is understanding the extent to which the existing economic and business policy architecture contributes toward creating an adequately enabling environment for youth-led entrepreneurship innovation to flourish. The study offers an opportunity for raising awareness about existing policy frameworks that facilitate young people’s access to economic opportunities and documenting the challenges faced by young entrepreneurs especially those attempting to do business across the borders at regional and continental level within the Frameworks of Regional Economic Commissions.</p>
									<p>For African governments, development partners, private sector and other actors, investing in youth entrepreneurship innovation capital and taking proactive measures to include young business leaders in decision-making associated with the economic governance processes should be observed as an indicator for success. Furthermore, the study seeks to lay an evidence based firm foundation for attempting to mobilize governments, development partners, private sector and other relevant stakeholders to meaningfully engage with, facilitate African young people and support them with skills, tools and an enabling environment to create solutions for cross border trade such as e-commerce platforms. The study will build on and add to existing futuristic scenarios of what is to be expected of the economic growth by young people, the role they see themselves play as stakeholders to achieving this ideal, and the capacity and other form of support required for them to effectively and meaningfully play such a role.<br>More on the study  and its findings here…</p>
